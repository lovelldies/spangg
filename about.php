  <p style="font-size: 1.3rem;  line-height: 2rem; margin: 50px 0;">Spangg was founded in August 2013 by Adarsh and Tiqvah-el Varghese, <br>  corporate professionals who have spent many years working at Facebook and Google. <br> We have a presence in Hyderabad and Vizag, India, and in Dublin, Ireland <br> and have served clients in India, UAE, UK, USA, Germany and Australia. <br> Spangg rhymes with 'bang' and means 'spot on / exactly / on target' &ndash; rather presumptuous, <br> we know, but we've been vindicated so far <img src="./img/slightly-smiling-face.png" style="width:16px;" alt="Smiling"></p>
